I'm not a big fan of using a mouse because it forces me to move my hands from the home row.
I have similar stance on trackpads, although they are a bit better.

What really makes me feel good is trackpoints. They are probably less accurate but way more comfortable for me.
Plus my workflow is mostly keyboard driven and I only need to move the cursor occasionally.

Below is a list of keyboards I used that have trackpoint.

## Thinkpad keyboard

This was the first external keyboard I bought after switching from my Thinkpad X1 Carbon to Dell XPS 9500.
The discomfort of using dell's trackpad made me buy this keyboard.

I love it. One of the best keyboards I had. The only downside is it's not programmable.<br>
It's very important for me to
make CapsLock button behave as Control on the keyboard level, because when I connect it to another machine I want my keyboard
to function as I used to. It made this keyboard not fully portable for me as that remaping friction caused quite a bit of frustration on my end.

Other than that - perfect.

## Tex - Shura

Another nice keyboard I have (mine has one solid space bar though). It is programmable so that issue with the CapsLock mapping
is eliminated with this keyboard.

Unfortunately for me, I can't use it for long period of time. My wrists start to hurt after using it for a few weeks.
I had to switch to my laptop's keyboard (M1 Mac book), though occasionally I use Shura for a couple of days at a time.

It's not the first mechanical keyboard where I discovered I have issues with using them. They always cause quite discomfort for my hands
even though it is very comfortable from "home row perspective".

I got some recommendations from my colleagues to use palm rest and it does solve the issue but it creates another point of discomfort
as my portability is reduced.<br>
At work I have meetings and I want to grab my laptop+keyboard which I don't like but still can do.
Grabbing laptop+keyboard+palmrest is too much.

## Not sure what my other options are

I'm looking at low profile mechanical keyboards now but there aren't that many options that I can easily try without
paying too much.

There is [Santoku Gen 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/oisnad/i_made_this_santoku_gen_2_trackpoint_as_a/) that I might try one day.

Unfortunately the market of keyboards with trackpoints isn't too big.
