Hey everyone.

## Links first

* [DEB (Ubuntu/Debian/Mint/etc...)](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux/releases/)
* [RPM (Fedora/Suse/etc...)](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux/releases/)
* [Portable Windows version](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux/releases/)

Here is the [Github](https://github.com/KryDos/todoist-linux) page of the project.
You can download releases from there as well.

## Global keybindings

* CTRL+ALT+a - quick add a task
* CTRL+ALT+t - show or hide the app window

These are the only keybindings I need. If you need anything else let me know.

## Motivation

I thought it should be good idea to have Todoist opened as an application instead of tab in a browser.

Todoist supports a lot of different platforms but not Linux.
So I've made Electron wrapper for Todoist's web version.

The main reason why I couldn't use it as a web version is lack of global keybindings.

Let me know about bugs or features you want to see in the project.
