title: Tmux. Change default start directory
---

Hi,

if you use tmux you could notice that every time you create new window
it starts in the directory where you initiated your Tmux session.

Usually I start my Tmux at home directory but when I work for a project
I like to have all my windows to be opened in this particular project.

Sure I can close the session and start the new one from the project directory but... no.

The way you can do it from withing Tmux is press your `<prefix>+:` to open the command mode.

Now enter `attach -c <your-default-start-directory>`.
That's all.

It works outside of Tmux as well. You can run it this way `tmux attach-session -t <you session> -c <your-default-start-directory>`.
