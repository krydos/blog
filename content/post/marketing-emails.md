It feels strange that I always receive a lot of marketing emails despite the fact that I never subscribed to any.

I even feel like I have control over it because of that tiny "Unsubscribe" link that is always available.<br>
I locate it in less than a second, click it and bye bye little annoying email - you're done. I can even detect the tricks from these unsubscribe tools
when they unsubscribe me and then show me the big green button saying **Confirm and *subscribe* again** which is supposed to trick me.<br>
But I'm untrickable! Haha!

I just did the same to "LA GRANDE ABBUFFATA PIZZA+PASTA PARTY" (whatever that is) email but now I feel tricked on another level.<br>
I'm just part of this strange process where businesses:
- subscribe me to their marketing material
- [government tells them to make sure people can unsubscribe](https://www.acma.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-05/Fact%20sheet%20-%20email%20and%20SMS%20unsubscribe%20rules.pdf)
- businesses comply
- I receive marketing emails
- I unsubscribe
- the circle repeats

Seems like everybody gets what they want here except me.

How much value was produced in this circle? Probably some, right? Right?<br>
Maybe somebody has a job and can support their family because of it. I really hope so.<br>
I can slightly suffer for this reason.

I do appreciate the trick...
