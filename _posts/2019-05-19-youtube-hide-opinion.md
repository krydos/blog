description: Firefox extension to hide rate on Youtube videos
---

Watching videos on Youtube I've noticed I influenced a lot by paying
attention to a video rating.
For example if rating is negative I initially treat a video as unprofessional or even stupid.

I tried to ignore a video rating but it's pretty hard so I decided to build a browser extension that should hide the rating.

So meet [Youtube hide Opinion](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-hide-opinion/)
the Firefox extension.

<a target="_blank" href="/assets/img/hide-opinion1.png"><img alt="fun first" src="/assets/img/hide-opinion1.png" width="550px"/></a>

As you can see you still can up/down vote a video but you don't see it's rating.

The extension also supports **Enhancer for YouTube**.

P.S.
Some time ago I also published this extension to [Google's WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-hide-opinion/kmagnigdjocidngajmobbifcngjoejkm)
