Just met this nice article by Laurie Voss called `You suck at technical interviews`.

Here is TL;DR from there:


* many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life
* you want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now
* or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly
* you want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do
* your interview should be a collaborative conversation, not a combative interrogation
* you also want somebody who you will enjoy working with
* it's important to separate "enjoy working with" from "enjoy hanging out with"
* don't hire assholes, no matter how good they are
* if your team isn't diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be
* accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard

Good read.
