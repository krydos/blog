Hey everyone.

I already have a post about [GDB Dashboard]({% post_url 2018-02-19-gdb-dashboard %}) package which is cool but I've just found somethine even better.

Meet [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda). It looks really awesome. I wasn't able to try all the commands
it provides but the interface looks pretty awesome.

It shows stask in realtime which Dashboard package lack. Not just showing addresses but also strings
if any of them are on the address.

Now my GDB looks like debuggers I have used to before like OllyDbg.

If you use GDB a lot especially for software exploring you have to try the PEDA package.


Here is screenshot from their repo.
