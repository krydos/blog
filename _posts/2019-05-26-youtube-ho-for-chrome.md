Today I decided to port my [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-hide-opinion/) to Google Chrome.

Meet [Youtube Hide Opinion For Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-hide-opinion/kmagnigdjocidngajmobbifcngjoejkm).

Turned out, I should change nothing in the extension to make it
working in Google Chrome (thanks to [Browser Extensions specification](https://browserext.github.io/browserext/))

Now to kill the good feeling I have to say that to publish
the extension to WebStore I had to make $5 one-time payment.
Pretty symbolic payment but still feels foreign while publishing open source code.
